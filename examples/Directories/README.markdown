Building with Gaudi example #2
------------------------------
Simple example to write out a text file
and create a directory.

Here you will see that `gaudi` is invoked in a very 
similar manner to the traditional `make` tool.

Assuming Gaudi is installed, to generate the file and directory (invoke `build` action) just
run:

> `gaudi`

To remove the generated file and directory, invoke the `clean` action with:

> `gaudi clean`
