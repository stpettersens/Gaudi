Building with Gaudi example
---------------------------
Simple example Hello World program
written in C++ and the Gaudi build file to build it.

Here you will see that `gaudi` is invoked in a very 
similar manner to the traditional `make` tool.

Assuming Gaudi is installed, to build the program (invoke `build` action) just
run:

> `gaudi`

To remove the compiled program, invoke the `clean` action with:

> `gaudi clean`
