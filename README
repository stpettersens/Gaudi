Gaudi is a platform agnostic build tool
written in Scala which runs on a Java virtual machine (JVM).

As it is a build tool, it is named after an architect, Antoni Gaudí;
the designer of the famous Sagrada Família.

Gaudi can be thought of as being similar to
Apache Ant in that it abstracts commands related
to building software away from the operating system 
(e.g. "rmve" instead of "rm" on Unix-likes or "del" on Windows); 
but differs in that:

* Its build files are based on a JSON rather than an XML format.

* It is not tailored to offer advanced features for a particular
  language, unlike Ant which is highly specialised for Java development.

* It is licensed under the MIT License rather than the Apache License
  (except third party libraries where applicable).

Gaudi's implementation has been inspired by both Ant and Make.

Gaudi should be compatible with most modern JVMs
and has been tested with and is known to work
with Sun's Java HotSpot/OpenJDK JVM and Apache Harmony/DRLVM.
