Building and generation scripts for Gaudi
-----------------------------------------

These are _Bash shell scripts_ which can be used
on Linux/Unix-like systems and Cygwin 
to build Gaudi and generate its distributables 
(e.g. all-in-one jar or Windows executables)

These scripts should be run from the root directory.
For example:

`sam@ubuntu:~/Gaudi$ sh/build.sh`

... will build Gaudi.
